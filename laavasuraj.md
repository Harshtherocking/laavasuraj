# Goal is to learn not memorise

#### Saturaday - Github 
- setup `.ssh` key on github (`docs` or `video`) (dont worry if you dont understand the steps)
- `fork` this on github website - you ll have your own version of that repo
- `git clone` the repo which is on your github (use __ssh__ link) 
- check `git status`
- make a new *txt file* inside a new *folder* and write what you dont like.
- check `git status`
- `git add` this new folder  
- check `git status`
- make a *new file* in *parent directory* (orginal repo directory) and write what you like.
- check `git status`
- `git add` this new file
- check `git status`
- `git commit -m <msg>` to commit (preparation for remote change) with a message  
- `git push origin <branch>` branch is *main*
- check github page and notice changes
- `git rm` every changes done in the repo
- check `git status`
- `git commit -m <msg>` to commit (about to change remote repo ie. repo on github) with some meaningful message.
#### Sunday - PyTorch 
- make a class of named `LinearTransformTranspose` which has method taking in a Tensor of shape `(x,y)` and return a transpose Tensor of shape `(2,x)`  
- make a `Module` for the illustration below (study what `module` is in Pytorch) getting help from *examples* on the official website **ONLY**; define **forward** method to show transformation.

### Suraj Harlekar 2022BCD0038
#### Weekend - Llama Index
- learn `OOPS` concepts in `Python3`
- complete *get started* on the official website (important to know what library actually provides and its limitations)
- download pdf of a mini-book (10 pages max) or a research paper.
- `parse` pdf to get `List[Document]`
- `pickle` these to some directory to save it.
- explore `Document` object - try changing & printing `metadata`, `content` etc.
- explore **3** `vector databases` (atleast) and code their minimal working in Llama index (checkout `Index` in `llama index`)
- explore *retrieval techniques* in different databases (code and obverse output)
- build a class with methods defined for taking in the pdf and returning `List[Doc]`; Takes in `Index` (find what `index` means in llama index) and return `Index` containing `Document` in it. Basically adding `Document` entries in `Index`

Dekho main tum dono ko judge nhi kr rha. I still believe tum log kaam karoge. So try kro you dont lie to me jitna bhi aata hai mujhe batao. These tasks are meant for you to learn. Easy task hain so try not gpt-ing them. Kuch error aaye try fixing it yourself or take help from internet (no video and chatbots) becoz kabhi kabhi a mistake can be just a spelling mistake. Try uploading your work on github.(if nhi ho rha adh vide). **GOOD LUCK**.
